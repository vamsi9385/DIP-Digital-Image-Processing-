### Sobel edge detection
Sobel edge detection is a common technique used in image processing to detect edges in an image. It works by computing the gradient magnitude of the image intensity at each pixel, which highlights rapid changes in intensity that typically occur at edges. The Sobel operator is a popular method for performing edge detection.
